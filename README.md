# A Crypto Wallet in React

A simple bare bones Crypto Wallet built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). The TestNet currently supports LTC. You can make a deposit into the wallet by sending Litecoins to the address shown, using [this LTC faucet](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/). The wallet displays your balance and allows you to send Litecoins to a friend. Build using [Bitcoin Computer](https://bitcoin-computer.gitbook.io/docs/).

To create a new wallet address you can change the seed, generating a new one from [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).
